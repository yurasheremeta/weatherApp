Weather Widget Web Application (SPA)
Required Stack:
- React
- React Router
- TypeScript
- Zustand
- React Query
User Flow:
1. A user signs up for the application by entering an email (no backend integration required,
client-side validation only).
2. After signing up, the user is redirected to the home page, which consists of:
- An input field in the center to enter a city.
- An avatar icon in the top right corner displaying the email entered upon signup.
3. The user should be able to enter the name of any EU country&#39;s capital city in English.
4. Upon submitting a city, a mock request should be made to simulate receiving weather results
for the current and the next day.
4.1 The forecast for each day should include:
- Date
- Random mocked morning, afternoon, evening, and night forecasts (if, for example, it is
currently afternoon, there&#39;s no need to show the morning forecast).
5. The application should be responsive.
6. Use any architectural pattern, taking into consideration the scalability of the application.
7. Ensure intuitive UX/UI.
8. Home and Sign Up pages should be under different routes.
9. No need to deploy an application.
10. Small things to consider
10.1 Use absolute imports
Feel free to use any other npm packages.
The code can be published to any publicly available repository.
